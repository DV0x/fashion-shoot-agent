# VIDEO_PROMPTS

## Prompt Writing Tips

- Describe camera equipment + motion: "slowly and smoothly dollies", "lifts on a boom", "jib arm"
- Use positive prompting: "The subject is completely still" (not "does not move")
- Prescribe stillness for everything: "background is completely still"
- If subject pose changes between frames: "The subject's movements are extremely deliberate and precise"

## Frame 1: Beauty Portrait — SLOW PUSH + MICRO-ORBIT

**Movement:** Dolly In + Subtle Arc

```
The camera slowly and smoothly dollies in toward the face
while subtly orbiting from front to a three-quarter angle.
The subject is completely still. The background is completely still.
Camera ends close to the face at a three-quarter angle.
```

**Boundary:** Ends CLOSE, 3/4 ANGLE (xfade on stillness to Frame 2)

---

## Frame 2: High-Angle 3/4 — CORKSCREW DESCEND

**Movement:** Jib Down + Roll

```
The camera slowly and smoothly descends on a jib arm from overhead,
sweeping downward in an arc toward ground level. The horizon tilts gently
as the camera falls, creating a subtle spiral effect.
The subject is completely still. The environment is completely still.
Camera ends at ground level, angled upward toward the subject.
```

**Boundary:** Ends GROUND LEVEL → matches Frame 3 start

---

## Frame 3: Low-Angle Full Body — WORM'S EYE ORBIT + RISE

**Movement:** Low Dolly Arc + Boom Up

```
The camera slowly and smoothly arcs at ground level on a low dolly,
circling around the subject's feet. The camera then lifts on a boom,
rising along the side of the body from ankle height toward the waist.
The subject is completely still. The ground and background are completely still.
Camera ends at the side of the subject in profile view.
```

**Boundary:** Ends SIDE PROFILE → matches Frame 4 start

---

## Frame 4: Side Profile — DOLLY ZOOM

**Movement:** Vertigo Effect (dolly in + focal length widens)

```
The camera slowly and smoothly dollies in toward the subject's profile
while the focal length gradually widens, stretching the background perspective.
The subject remains the same size in frame while the space compresses behind them.
The subject is completely still. The background warps but the subject is frozen.
Camera ends close to the face in profile.
```

**Boundary:** Ends CLOSE → matches Frame 5 start

---

## Frame 5: Close Portrait — UNMOTIVATED PUSH

**Movement:** Slow Creep + Micro-Roll

```
The camera slowly and smoothly dollies in toward the face at an almost
imperceptible pace. The horizon tilts very slightly as the camera creeps closer,
creating a subtle tension. The movement is extremely deliberate and precise.
The subject is completely still. The background is completely still.
Camera ends extremely close to the eye or lips, frame slightly canted.
```

**Boundary:** Ends EXTREME CLOSE / DETAIL → matches Frame 6 start

---

## Frame 6: Extreme Detail — PROBE DRIFT + PULL BACK

**Movement:** Macro Drift + Dolly Out

```
The camera slowly and smoothly drifts across the texture of the fabric
at extreme close range, like a probe lens exploring the surface.
The camera then slowly and smoothly dollies out to reveal the detail in context.
The subject is completely still. The fabric and accessories are completely still.
Camera ends with a slightly wider view of the garment element.
```

**Boundary:** FINAL SHOT — resolves the sequence

---

## Transition Flow

```
Frame 1 (Beauty)      Frame 2 (High-Angle)    Frame 3 (Low-Angle)
  SLOW PUSH        →     CORKSCREW        →    WORM'S EYE
 ends: CLOSE 3/4      ends: GROUND           ends: SIDE
        │                    │                    │
        ▼                    ▼                    ▼
Frame 6 (Detail)      Frame 5 (Close)        Frame 4 (Profile)
  PROBE DRIFT      ←   UNMOTIVATED PUSH  ←    DOLLY ZOOM
 ends: RESOLVE         ends: DETAIL          ends: CLOSE
```

**Note:** Transitions use xfade on stillness — camera positions don't need to match exactly.
