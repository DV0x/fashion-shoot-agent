## VIDEO_PROMPT_1: Beauty Portrait → Subtle Orbital Arc

```
Slow orbital arc (5-10°) around the face, drifting slightly upward. Reveals cheekbone dimension while maintaining shallow depth of field. Subject's gaze holds steady with micro-expressions. The editorial offset angle and bone structure emphasis remain throughout.
```

---

## VIDEO_PROMPT_2: High-Angle 3/4 → Descending Jib

```
Camera descends on a gentle arc while rotating 15° around subject. Starts overhead, settles toward 3/4 high angle. Reveals wardrobe geometry from multiple elevations. The shape abstraction quality transforms as perspective shifts. Movement is smooth and elegant.
```

---

## VIDEO_PROMPT_3: Low-Angle Full → Low Oblique Push

```
Camera holds low to ground, pushing slowly along the oblique diagonal toward subject. The elongated silhouette looms larger as we approach. Footwear and full figure remain in frame. Perspective distortion intensifies subtly. The dramatic low angle is maintained throughout.
```

---

## VIDEO_PROMPT_4: Side-On Profile → Lateral Track

```
Telephoto tracking shot sliding parallel to subject. Compressed background drifts opposite to camera direction. Subject in clean profile, garment structure flattens elegantly. The long lens compression creates a refined, editorial quality throughout.
```

---

## VIDEO_PROMPT_5: Worm's Eye Shoe → Low Drift

```
Low camera drifts forward toward extended foot from ground level. Wide-angle distortion emphasizes shoe construction, texture, and detailing. The worm's eye perspective creates fashion-forward abstraction. Movement is subtle—let the unusual angle carry the visual drama.
```

---

## VIDEO_PROMPT_6: Extreme Detail → Macro Drift

```
Steady drift across texture, accessory, or wardrobe detail from non-intuitive angle. Focus travels across surface, revealing material depth and craftsmanship. Movement speed is glacial—imperceptible start, visible mid-shot. Abstract and editorial.
